    <h2 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Explore Your Emotions</h2>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      What does it mean to feel your emotions? How do you do that?</p>
      <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;"> 
      In a nutshell, feeling your feelings is the art of decoding 
      what’s going on with you beneath the surface. Beneath the smile. Beneath 
      all the doing and distractions that you could bury yourself in as an 
      attempt to avoid what’s really going on emotionally. Beneath the part 
      of us that’s not being truthful when saying, “I’m good,” “I’m fine.” 
      “Everything is great,” when it’s really not.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      It’s easy to get in the habit of ignoring or disconnecting from our 
      inner world, especially if past situations have brought up big, intense 
      emotions. If we’ve experienced a past situation that brought up emotions 
      that were too much for us to handle at the time, we might have picked up 
      the habit of shutting off emotionally in order to self-protect. If we 
      didn’t have the skills or support to cope when hard experiences presented, 
      it’s a natural response to shut down and numb out emotions that are too 
      painful to feel.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      The issue with this tactic is that shutting down emotions consistently 
      can become a bad habit and lead to a permanent disconnect from our emotional state. 
      If you want to live a life filled with meaningful connections and a solid relationship 
      with yourself, it’s important to hone the skill of expressing how you feel. Both to yourself and others.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      The skill of expressing ourselves can be challenging and is not something 
      that we all do with ease. To go further, unless we’ve put some time and 
      energy into building a foundation of “Self,” our expression will be limited. 
      “Self” means the relationship between you and you, which aligns with your 
      ability to connect to your inner truth.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    If we’re not in tune with who we are and how we feel, then expressing how we feel to others will be nearly impossible. Have you ever drawn a blank or became tongue tied when someone was trying to engage in a conversation that involved exploring and expressing your emotional world? If this has happened once or twice you sound pretty normal and human to me. However, if going blank and having nothing to contribute consistently when your emotions are being called toward self expression, it could benefit you to learn practices to help you express yourself with more clarity and confidence.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Our hope for this post is to help you understand that self-expression is 
      a skill that can be developed. It's not too late to improve your ability 
      to connect with yourself and others.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    In this post I’m going to point out 2 initial steps that you can take to begin exploring your internal world. Change always starts with awareness, so using these 2 steps to begin to tap into your emotional self will help you begin to feel. If you are intentional about putting awareness and energy into this area of your life, the concept of momentum and focused energy will help you become more in tune with your emotions in time. With practice you will be able to begin to feel your emotions and then hopefully start understanding them from there. 
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    Our emotions are always communicating to us through our physical symptoms, feelings and moods. Our job is to decode what these signals or symptoms are trying to tell us. Knowing what’s going on with you will help your relationships greatly because it will allow you to self express with more confidence and truth. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Step 1: Slow Down</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    Assess how fast you’re going in your life. When we’re constantly busy with tasks and “to do’s” we’re not creating the time to feel our emotions. There’s a fine line to distinguish between being productive and being distracted. In order to tap into how you’re feeling you need time to “sit with and process your emotions.” (We’ll go over this in Step 2)
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    An inability to connect to what’s going on with us emotionally creates a disconnect from our ability to self express. How can we be disconnected from ourselves and articulate our feelings clearly and successfully? Not very well, if at all, my friends.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    The first step is to create the space for emotions to come to the surface and be heard and felt. Basically, the initial step is an inside job between you and you. It can take some time to become reacquainted with your disconnected self. This step is calling for you to get back in touch with the neglected pieces of you by exploring past experiences that were difficult and were left unprocessed. Slowing down will help you to create the space to spend some time sitting with and sifting through unresolved emotions that you left behind. “Unresolved emotions,” meaning emotions that were too hard, too uncomfortable or too big to be felt, for whatever reason, at the time.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    I hear you and I know that what I’m pointing you toward may be extremely uncomfortable, maybe too uncomfortable. Please listen to that if that’s the case. If you’re feeling like you want to jump out of your skin by reading this, then I would point you toward finding a professional to help you through this first, very important step.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Step 2: Learn to Sit With Your Emotions</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    It’s amazing what we do to avoid our feelings. We distract with all sorts of numbing agents; unhealthy relationships, alcohol, drugs, binge watching tv, overuse of social media, over eating, over working, over scheduling, etc. It can get sneaky to detect our specific form of distraction because it can appear in the form of overdoing good things; over cleaning, over organizing, etc. Note to self: Over doing anything is imbalanced and excessive.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    The thing with emotions is that if we push them down, they don’t go away; They just become repressed. Repressed emotions are emotions that we unconsciously avoid in order to not feel their discomfort. Like I said, difficult emotions don’t disappear. They manifest into other things like over reactions, short tempers, snippy comments, passive aggressive behaviors and, overtime, symptoms like depression or anxiety. 
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      If you find it difficult to stay with uncomfortable emotions, be gentle with yourself 
      and bring in curiosity to explore what’s at the root of your feelings. 
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Self-compassion is crucial. Avoid self-criticism and judgment, and treat yourself 
      with the same kindness you'd show to a good friend.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      These steps can help you become more in tune with your emotions and ultimately 
      improve your self-expression and relationships with others.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Step 3: Name the Feeling</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    When you become aware of a feeling, pause. See if you can notice the general tone of the emotion present. Is it positive or negative? See if you can name the specific emotion that you’re experiencing without judgment. (For example : Is it sadness? Is it fear?Is it shame? Is it excitement? Is it anxiety? What are you feeling?</p>



    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Step 4: Tap Into the Feeling Physically</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    Emotions are called “feelings” because we feel them in the body. Close your eyes and see if you can observe where the emotion is lying physically within. Is it in your chest? Your throat? Your stomach? Encourage yourself to “allow” the sensations to be present without trying to control, reduce, or escape them. If the feelings are difficult, this requires the courage to stay with an uncomfortable emotion. (I know, I know, it’s hard.)</p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
If you’re having difficulty tapping into what’s going on for you, it can help to bring in curiosity. Be curious about the sensation you’re feeling. Be present by following your curiosity and asking internal questions. Is the sensation pleasant or unpleasant? Is the energy you’re feeling light or heavy? Give the body permission to feel whatever is there. Stay with this experience for as long as you can. A minute or two is suggested.
</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Step 5: Explore What’s at the Root of Your Feelings</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    Shift your attention toward connecting what event or circumstance could be driving the emotion. (A loss, a transition, a fight with a friend, a hard conversation, a break up, etc.) Avoid thinking about assumptions or getting stuck in a story about the event or circumstance that’s creating your feeling state. Rather, stay present by focusing on facts. Keep it simple by asking : What’s at the root of my emotion? Why am I sad? Why am I nervous? Why am I angry? Why am I hurt?</p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
See if you can feel without self blame or pointing the finger at another. The goal is to go beyond surface emotions to get into the root source of your particular emotion. Stay present and with your breath in order to do this.
</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Step 6: Ditch Self Criticism With Kindness</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
    As you allow your feelings, bring kindness and self compassion to your experience (especially if it’s a tough one that’s causing you a lot of pain and suffering). Refrain from self criticism and judgement. Do your best to hold space for self compassion. If this is difficult for you to do, think about what you would say to your best friend If they were feeling your specific emotion. You might say to them: “I’m so sorry you’re going through this,” “I know this is hard,” or “I’m here for you.” This step is about actively bringing a self loving stance to your experience. One of the most important things you can do in this life is learn how to treat yourself with respect and kindness. This respect that you give to yourself will be reflected back to you in all sorts of ways in this life.</p>

<p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
I know that being in tune with your emotions and expressing yourself effectively could be really hard to do. I hope that these initial steps help you to chip away at the blocks and avoidance mechanisms that may have built up overtime. With practice your desire to understand what’s going on with you emotionally will help you in all areas of your life. Things will feel a lot lighter and conflict will be less and handled with way more success when you know how to self express.

    <h2 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">9 Mindful Habits To Improve Your Mental Health</h2>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      With the increasing professional pressure and struggling with prioritizing 
      relationships and well-being, we often forget about our mental health and 
      suffer from various disorders. We tend to neglect our joy and priorities, 
      leading to significant long-term effects on mental health.
    </p>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Let's discuss some healthy mindful habits for the betterment of our mental health.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Meditation</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Meditation is exploring yourself with no final destination, unaware of 
      what exactly you are looking for. When we meditate, we gain better clarity 
      by encountering the moments stored in our minds.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Focus on the Present</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Opportunity knocks every moment, and each day is a new beginning. Don't 
      wait for the right moment; make the most of the time you have today. 
      Constantly planning the future or worrying about past mistakes can lead 
      to a vicious cycle with no fruitful results.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Reframe Your Thoughts</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Our thoughts are powerful weapons that can either help us grow or block our growth. 
      Negativity is easily influential, but the difference lies in how we pursue it. 
      The key to a positive mindset is to start slow and reframe negative thoughts 
      into more positive ones.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Try Mindful Eating</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Stress eating can be tempting when worried, but managing what, when, 
      and how much we eat is crucial. Healthy and mindful eating provides the 
      energy needed to go through the day without feeling sluggish.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Be Kind to Yourself</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      We often add to our daily stress by judging and questioning ourselves. 
      To manage mental health, be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that you 
      are enough and deserve happiness.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Apply Mindfulness to Your Relationships</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Before being too hard on yourself, be mindful of your relationships. 
      Start conversations instead of holding grudges, and focus on the positive 
      aspects of others.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Clean Up</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Busy with day-to-day life, we often neglect organizing and cleaning up. 
      This can stress us out. Clear your space to welcome new things and reduce 
      unnecessary stress.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Connect With Nature</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Nature can calm the mind and reduce frustration. Spend time outdoors 
      to bring a positive mindset and reduce stress.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">Try a Sleep Scan</h3>
    <p style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
      Sleep plays a major role in our health. Try deep breathing and relaxing 
      to get undisturbed sleep, allowing you to start each day fresh.
